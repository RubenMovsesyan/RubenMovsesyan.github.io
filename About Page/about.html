                <p>My name is Ruben Movsesyan and I am a graduate of Computer Engineering from the University of California at Santa Cruz. During my time in school I did a little bit of work in different fields of engineering and software development. The goal behind creating this website is to explore some of those topics in more depth and see what kinds of creations I can produce using said concepts. Some of the concepts that I am currently exploring are parallel programming and gpu programming. To do so I am using the WebGPU api for JavaScript. WebGPU is not yet supported on all browsers but it is supported on the latest version of chrome. And while there are many other ways to achieve graphics programming on the web that are compatible with all browsers, I have decided to use WebGPU because it is a developing technology and allows access to writing compute shaders, opening parallel computing to many more possibilities.</p>
